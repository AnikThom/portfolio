            <b>Hello! My name is Anice Thompson.</b><br><br>
            I am currently a senior attending Troy University 
            pursuing my bachelors in computer science.<br><br>
            Between pursuing my PH.D, my masters, or seeking employment in web or game development,
            much of my immediate future is unclear.<br><br>
            Ultimately, I would like to create a small indie game company and tell many intriguing and thought-provoking stories through my work,
            while creating extensive worlds filled with mysteries and secrets to be uncovered.
            My dream job has been to tell stories through games since I was in elementary school,
            and every day I stray closer to this goal.
